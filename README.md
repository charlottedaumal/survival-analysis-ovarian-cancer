## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project applies statistical survival analysis methods to clinical data from a cohort of 26 patients diagnosed with advanced ovarian carcinoma. The dataset originates from the seminal study by Edmunson et al. (1979) and investigates how treatments and patient-specific factors influence survival outcomes.

The analysis includes:

- Univariate and bivariate exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Kaplan-Meier survival estimation
- Log-rank tests
- Cox proportional hazards regression modeling
- Assessment of model assumptions using Schoenfeld, Martingale, and Deviance residuals

## ðŸ“š Dataset

The dataset consists of the following clinical and demographic variables:

| Variable   | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `futime`   | Survival or censoring time (in days) |
| `fustat`   | Censoring status (1 = death, 0 = censored) |
| `age`      | Age of the patient |
| `resid.ds` | Residual disease (1 = none, 2 = present) |
| `rx`       | Treatment (1 = single therapy, 2 = combination therapy) |
